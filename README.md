# YanPes Dotfiles

**My personal development environment configs** — a collection of shell and editor settings I use to bootstrap my workstation.

This repository contains configuration files (dotfiles) that help me quickly set up a consistent working environment on any linux based system.

As I constantly optimize my workflows, this repository will be under constant change to reflect my current way of working.

## 📦 What’s Included

This repo currently includes:

- **Neovim configurations** (`nvim/`) — my setup for a modern Vim experience  
- **Zsh setup** (`.zshrc`) — shell configuration and aliases  
- **Tmux config & startup script** (`.tmux.conf`, `.tmux-startup.sh`) — terminal multiplexer preferences

> These files customize tools I use daily to boost productivity and maintain consistency across machines.
